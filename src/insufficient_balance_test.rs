/// Test: repay fails when the contract has insufficient balance to cover yield payouts.
///
/// Scenario:
///   - Contract is funded with exactly the loan amount (no yield reserve).
///   - After disbursement the contract balance is 0.
///   - Borrower repays principal + yield; contract receives the payment but then
///     must transfer `stake + yield` back to the voucher — which exceeds what it holds.
///   - The token transfer panics at the host level; `try_repay` must return an error.
