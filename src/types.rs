//! # Stroop Unit Convention
//!
//! **All monetary amounts in this contract are denominated in stroops.**
//!
//! | Unit  | Value                      |
//! |-------|----------------------------|
//! | 1 XLM | 10,000,000 stroops         |
//! | 1 stroop | 0.0000001 XLM           |
//!
//! This applies to every `i128` field or parameter that represents a token
//! amount (stakes, loan principals, yield, fees, minimums, etc.).
//! When displaying values to end-users, divide by `10_000_000` to convert
//! to XLM. When accepting user input in XLM, multiply by `10_000_000`
//! before passing to contract functions.
